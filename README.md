# Azure OpenAI Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is a concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves embedding descriptions of tasks in input to prompt an AI model to output the desired results.  A prompt typically includes the problem description, instructions on how to solve the problem,Â and examples of correct problem and solution pairs.

This [notebook](AOAI_PromptEngineering.ipynb) provides a few samples of prompts used to accomplish tasks like, text generation, summarization, and classification using the Azure OpenAI Service.  Instructions for configuring your environment using the sample config.json in this repo are in the **Parameter Configuration** section of the notebook.
